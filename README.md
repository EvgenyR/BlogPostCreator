A personal tool to make writing and formatting blog posts easier
---------------

I publish blog post on
[blogger - programming blog] justmycode.blogspot.com
[blogger - digital biology blog] southernblot.blogspot.com
[my website] www.ynegve.info

I'm updating this tool to help me faster and easier format the posts the way I would like them to be.

99% of the time I use paragraphs, headers or titles, images, links and code examples. The tool saves the draft of the blog post in XML format. When the post is ready, the tool parses the resulting XML and generates two text files:

1. The post that is formatted for blogger.com
2. The source code that can be added to my website project. (My website is written in C#/MVC using Entity Framework and code first, so every time I want to add a post I add appropriate code to the database "seed" function
